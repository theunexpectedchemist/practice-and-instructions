Well, well, well. Getting the hang of things. Here's how it works.
First, create a repository. Use the "+" all the way at the top right (near the Github logo/log off icon) for that.
(You can insist that this have a "readme" file in it, but it's not required.)
That repository will have branches. If no branches were ever created for it, then the one branch it will have is called "master."
That "master" branch is always the topmost one.
If you wanted a readme file, you'll find that as a file in the lower (and usually more active) area.
You can (and probably will) add files to this in some way.
To do so, you can click on "Add new file" on the right of the active area. However, this will add the file to the Master branch only.
What would become more useful would be to put the file into a different branch, so that any work on the different branch will
not affect what was put into the Master branch (until this is desired).
The easiest way to create a new branch is to click on the Branch: pull down menu on the left (and slightly above) the active area.
This pull down menu is also the easiest way to navigate immediately to the desired branch.
Another way to navigate to the desired branch would be to click on the "Branch" text above the active area.
However, this gets you to an "overview" of all the branches. It is very important to be able to do this, because this overview is
the best way to delete an entire branch. (Just click on "delete" on the right.)
You can easily get to the branch from the "overview" part by clicking on the correct branch.
But back to adding files: When in the correct branch (which might be the Master), click the button that reads "Add new file."
This will open an editor (just like the one that we're in right now), where you can add text.
Before adding text, or editing text, you will have to click on the "pen" on the upper right of the bar over the text.
After adding whatever text you want to the file, you will have to "commit" that file. That's very similar to saving the file, but
it not only saves the file, it throws in a record of what was changed since the last time there was a "commit."
In this way, you can keep adding to the files and adding more files.
In order to delete files, you must first open them. Before clicking on the pen icon that edits the text, you can click on the
garbage can "delete" icon right near it. That will delete your file.
In order to see the differences between the file text as it is now and as it was before editing, you'll have to click on the "Update"
text to the right of the text that opens the file for editing.
Blue text is text added since the last time, and red text is text that got deleted since the last time.
(You might notice that you can add comments to the times that there were edits, which is useful if you want to remember or show the
reason that the edits were made. It seems simple but I have not done this yet.)
mentioned above.
Very important: There is blue text that denotes the repository name and the file you are under. Clicking on these are very important
ways to get back to places above, either to the repository area or the file area, from wherever you are (such as the "overview" area).
(So far I use it as an "emergency get me out of this place" button.)
A branch can have a "pull request." That means that the branch comes with a sort of request that it be modified.
I don't know what else the "pull request" is for.

This branch can be committed as a branch "under" another branch.
		This is done when the radio button is chosen so that this is not a branch under master.
The real problem is finding the text to view and to edit. Remember, this is found under the branches.
	Use the drop-down menu of "Find or create a branch" to locate the branch you want.
	Choose the branch you want.
	The "View" is tempting, but that's just a view of the pull request, not of the file.
	You'll have to choose the files whose names are listed.
Random: You don't need to have an open pull request to edit the file.
Now I'll try merging this thing.
To compare two versions, open the branch and don't click on the part that you want to change, but the "Update" part.
Then you'll be able to compare the version with the previous one.

Merging it means that you have to open a pull request first.
After you do, you can go to the bottom of the page and merge it with the master. That will put all the files into the master.

There's a difference between the "Drop down" branch selector and the "Branch" clickable word.
The "drop down" selector gets you right to the branch, from which you can select the files you want. (You can't delete the branch here.)
The "Branch" clickable word gets you to a place where you can have an "overview" of the branch.
This place enables you to delete the branch entirely. Useful.
Notice that from this place, you can also select whichever file you want as well.

You can't open a closed pull request until you edit something and make a commit first.
