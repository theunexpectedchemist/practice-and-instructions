Well, well, well. Getting the hang of things. Here's how it works.
First, create a repository. Use the "+" all the way at the top right (near the Github logo/log off icon) for that.
(You can insist that this have a "readme" file in it, but it's not required.)
That repository will have branches. If no branches were ever created for it, then the one branch it will have is called "master."
That "master" branch is always the topmost one.
If you wanted a readme file, you'll find that as a file in the lower (and usually more active) area.
You can (and probably will) add files to this in some way.
To do so, you can 
	This has a readme.
	It must be committed.
	This becomes the "master" that will be the end of the whole project.
When anyone wants to do something, he must create a branch.
	This is done by "add file."
	Or by that pull-down on the left, called "Find or create a branch."
	The branch must be committed and should have a pull request.
	This branch can be committed as a branch "under" another branch.
		This is done when the radio button is chosen so that this is not a branch under master.
The real problem is finding the text to view and to edit. Remember, this is found under the branches.
	Use the drop-down menu of "Find or create a branch" to locate the branch you want.
	Choose the branch you want.
	The "View" is tempting, but that's just a view of the pull request, not of the file.
	You'll have to choose the files whose names are listed.
Random: You don't need to have an open pull request to edit the file.
Now I'll try merging this thing.
To compare two versions, open the branch and don't click on the part that you want to change, but the "Update" part.
Then you'll be able to compare the version with the previous one.

Merging it means that you have to open a pull request first.
After you do, you can go to the bottom of the page and merge it with the master. That will put all the files into the master.

There's a difference between the "Drop down" branch selector and the "Branch" clickable word.
The "drop down" selector gets you right to the branch, from which you can select the files you want. (You can't delete the branch here.)
The "Branch" clickable word gets you to a place where you can have an "overview" of the branch.
This place enables you to delete the branch entirely. Useful.
Notice that from this place, you can also select whichever file you want as well.

You can't open a closed pull request until you edit something and make a commit first.
