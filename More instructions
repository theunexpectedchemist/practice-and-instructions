Well, well, well. Getting the hang of things. Here's how it works.
In a repository, the first or main worker writes a program.
	This has a readme.
	It must be committed.
	This becomes the "master" that will be the end of the whole project.
When anyone wants to do something, he must create a branch.
	This is done by "add file."
	Or by that pull-down on the left, called "Find or create a branch."
	The branch must be committed and should have a pull request.
	This branch can be committed as a branch "under" another branch.
		This is done when the radio button is chosen so that this is not a branch under master.
The real problem is finding the text to view and to edit. Remember, this is found under the branches.
	Use the drop-down menu of "Find or create a branch" to locate the branch you want.
	Choose the branch you want.
	The "View" is tempting, but that's just a view of the pull request, not of the file.
	You'll have to choose the files whose names are listed.
